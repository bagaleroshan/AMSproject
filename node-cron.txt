Node Cron: (A Simple Task Scheduler)
    Node Cron is a lightweight JavaScript library for Node.js that allows you to schedule tasks based on the familiar Cron syntax. It's perfect for automating repetitive jobs like:

    -Data backups
    -Sending notifications
    -Generating reports
    -Cleaning up temporary files

    1. Installation:
        `npm install node-cron`

    
    2. Basic Usage:
        

        const cron = require('node-cron');

        cron.schedule('*/1 * * * *', () => {
            console.log('This task runs every minute');
        });




Cron Syntax
    The cron expression you provide defines the schedule for the task. 
    It consists of six fields separated by spaces:

        Second: 0-59
        Minute: 0-59
        Hour: 0-23
        Day of month: 1-31
        Month: 1-12 or Jan-Dec
        Day of week: 0-6 (Sunday=0 or 7)


        You can use various special characters:

            *: Matches all values for that field.
            -: Defines a range of values.
            ,: Separates multiple values.
            /: Specifies increments.


            example: 
            
           `cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', () => {
                console.log('This task runs every day at midnight');
            });`
