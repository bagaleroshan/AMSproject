1. What is <pre > tag and what it is used for?
   => The <pre> HTML tag is used to display text in a preformatted way. It preserves the original format of the text, including spaces and line breaks, making it useful for displaying code snippets, poetry, or other text that requires a specific layout.

   like font, Whitespace inside this element is displayed as written.

visibility: hidden=> Visibility:Hidden, Layout Space:Occupied, Interaction:No, Use Case:Hide content for layout or future use

4. Difference between absolute, relative, fixed and sticky positions

Static positioning: is the default for all elements and doesn't affect the normal document flow.
Absolutely positioned elements can overlap other elements.
Fixed positioning can cause layout issues when the content around it is scrollable.
Sticky positioning is a relatively new feature with some browser compatibility considerations.

Relative positions:(original position vanda top,right,left,bottom use garna painxa)
-The element is positioned relative to its normal (origin) position in the document flow.
-Remains in the document flow, so other elements are still positioned as if the relative element were in its original position.

Absolute positioning: (Document flow vanda bahira niskinxa)
-Positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor(parent) if there is non takes the viewport as its parent.
-Removed from the normal document flow, so it doesn't affect the position of other elements.
-Use case: Pop-up boxes, tooltips, images within a container.

Fixed Positioning:
-Positioned relative to the viewport.
-Removed from the document flow.
-Use case: Sidebars, navigation bars that stay put while scrolling.

Position Sticky:
-Itself within scrollable container (until threshold met)

- mix of relative and fixed.
  -stays in document flow(initially).
  -Use case: Headers that stay visible while scrolling content

centering a div:
position:absolute;
top:50%;
left:50%;
transform:translate(-50%,-50%);
